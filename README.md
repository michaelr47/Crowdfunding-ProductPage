## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS - no frameworks
- Functional Programming 

### What I learned
I learned a new css property which I was able to change the color of the radio checked which I thought was cool and neat.

```css
.bookmark { filter: invert(34%) sepia(74%) saturate(446%) hue-rotate(127deg) brightness(98%) contrast(94%); }
```

This resize event allowed me to display or not display the hamburger icon. Originally I was thinking of creating a function ON PAGE LOAD if page width is 768px or higher, then display nav menu OR if it was less than 768px, display hamburger icon. This resizing event is much better in this case. 
```js
window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
    let hamburger = document.querySelector('.hamburger');
    let windowSizeX = window.innerWidth;
    
    if (windowSizeX > 768) {
        hamburger.style.display = 'none';

    } else {
        hamburger.style.display = 'block';
    }
})
```
### Continued development

This was the first ever real project that I implemented the mobile first design and onwards to tablet and desktop. I will say its was pretty hard styling the css design for mobile first but gradually, I was getting into the rhythm of it and felt super easier than the other way around (Desktop to mobile). I will continue to implement mobile first designs ðŸ˜€.

### Useful resources

- [MDN css filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) - This allowed me to play around with it and was able to generate the correct color that I wanted for the radio button.
